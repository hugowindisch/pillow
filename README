MeatGrinder: The package grinder
================================
Takes a bunch of packages (package.json) and produces a folder that
can be statically served allowing to run these packages.

meat.js is the small js library that allows to require modules on the client.


    todo
    ----
    : check the versionning when dealing with dependencies
    : lint
    : minimize
    : generate compilation report on any request that failed

    : add a way to know that you are the topmost component (in the meat thing...) so
        you can startup differently when you are first required if you are the topmost thing.
		(-- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE--)
    
    done
    ----
    : the javascript require thing
    : generating an html that requires the module that is the main
    : server that auto publishes (autogrind)
    : better support for the require thing (like ... the module thing & other more quirky behaviors)
    : package dependencies support
    : multiple directories for grinding (allowing common modules... do we need this?)
        -> think about this one... this notion is probably useless (I mean the 
        common modules)
    : streaming for serving files
    : real 'make' capability (minimal regeneration)
	: in the html we need DEEP dependencies not only shallow ones
