the goal of this thing is to package a bunch of directories
as modules that will be loaded on the client side.


[bunch of folders] => [directory for static serving]
Mini server that serves [directory for static serving] and that dynamically regenerates it


------------

* we will have a bunch of client side applications that will be packaged
as modules

* we want the distinction of application and module + an application may have
external modules (so... an application can load in its own context OR globally)

* we want the notion of shared modules between all applications

* we want to be able to deal with images and other client side resources (the notion
that a module may have resources that it can load locally)

<a component is just a special standard format of a module (like exporting a create or something)>
<requiring will look locally and then globally>
<runtime-loading can be done in a local context or in the global context and is independent of the notion
of requiring... I mean requiring will go local first and then global but>
<one package creates ONE js file optionally linted and minimized>
<the output folder has the following structure

package1/
    package1.js
    assets/
        ... all static assets here
package2/
    package2.js
    assets/
        ... all static assets here
>
<the internal structure of a module contains all the individual files
function () {
    var mod =  {
        files: {
            file1: function () {
            },
            file2: function() {
            }
            folder1: function() {
            }
        }
        main: {
        }
    };
}

            - publish dir

        - walk dir looking for js files
        - lint file

        - walk dir looking for graphic (static) assets and copy them
        to the assets folder
        
    Static serving: only when something is LOADED it should be regenerated
        (like: when something is loaded in a given package

----------------
there is the notion of the 'packager' (the thing that creates the statically
served folder) and the notion of the loader itself.

at the packager level, maybe the the notion of app vs module is not required. This is a detail
of the loader itself (???) --> Not SURE this is possible...

todo
----
: check the versionning when dealing with dependencies
: lint
: minimize
: generate compilation report on any request that failed
: streaming for serving files and for copying files
: real 'make' capability (minimal regeneration)
: multiple directories for grinding (allowing common modules... do we need this?)
    -> think about this one... this notion is probably useless (I mean the 
    common modules)

done
----
: the javascript require thing
: generating an html that requires the module that is the main
: server that auto publishes (autogrind)
: better support for the require thing (like ... the module thing & other more quirky behaviors)
: package dependencies support
