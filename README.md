Pillow scans directories for commonJS packages and makes them accessible
in the browser (the packages are converted to a directory that can
be served statically).

Pillow can operate from the command line or as a server. When running as
a server it will regenerate everything on the fly (remake the packages
depending on what has changed in the source directories).

Images (png, jpg) are also copied to the output folder keeping the original
folder hierarchy relative to the package.json to which they belong.

Installation
============
npm install -g pillow


Command line operation
======================
This assumes the package was installed globally. If not, pillowscan aliases
to bin/pillowscan.js.

**pillowscan [options] folder1 [folder2..foldern] outputfolder**

With the following options:

**--help**: displays help information

**-jquery=filepath**: includes and integrates jquery using the provided sources

**-only=pathRelativeToDstFolder**: only remakes the specified file

**-cache=packageName,packageName2**: Use http caches for the specified package

**-cacheext=ext1,ext2,ext3**: Use http caches for the specified package

**-css**: Includes all dependent css files in the resulting html

**-html**: Generate a package.html

**-minify**: Minifies js file while packaging them

**-nomake=package1,package2,package3** : Prevents some packages from being
regenerated

**-port=portnumber**: Uses the specified port in server mode (instead of 1337)

example
-------

pillowscan mypackages myoutput

Will scan mypackages and its subdirectories and generate or update myoutput
that will contain properly packaged sources and assets.


Server operation
================
This assumes the package was installed globally. If not, pillowserve aliases
to bin/pillowserve.js.

**pillowserve [options] folder1 [folder2..foldern] outputfolder**

will make all packages loadable at:

http://localhost:1337/make/packageName/packageName.js

Library operation
=================

The following functions are available from the pillow package:

serve

makeAll

makePackage

makeFile

processArgs

findPackages

These will be documented later.

Structure of the output folder
==============================

The output folder will have the following structure:

    output/

        package1/

            package1.js

            some/

                subdir/

                    for/

                        images/

                            img1.png

Assuming that img1.png was located at ./some/subdir/for/images/img1.png relative
to the package.json file.

More advanced features
======================

Pillow supports many different applicationDomains (each applicationDomain
being able to have his own versions of packages). It also supports loading
or reloading packages at run time.
